# FIRST TRY WITH ONLY DES POSITIONS SENT TO SL
# 4 works well!!
# 6 is a longer movement
# 9 is the longest movement!
# 15 has an extremely good almost exciting initial movement! it starts very low!
# 18-19-20-21 are also quite good I would say!
# their combination though is not as exciting!

# SECOND TRY WITH DES POS,VEL,ACC SENT TO SL
# When we add torque limit checking
# only 9,15,18,20 works!
# 15, 18, 20 hit the ball!
# 19 reset the system!!!

# RECORDINGS: 15,18,20,20,18,15; last three with inv_dyn_fb turned on
