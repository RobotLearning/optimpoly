C code for Trajectory Generation for Table Tennis

This repository investigates the nonlinear constrained optimization
necessary to generate table tennis striking trajectories in joint space.
We use the NLOPT toolbox to run the constrained nonlinear optimization.

The hope is that the optimization for Barrett WAM can take under 2 ms.
