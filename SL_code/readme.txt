Do the following: 

1. initUserGraphics.c needs to have the display_ball_gun function!
2. initUserGraphics.c: add the function!
3. include the header files in the include/ path (since they initUserGraphics.c needs then the table.h header file!)

This was necessary as the simulation had problems with the 'standard' new-SL way
of writing graphics/sim.
